# pokemon-ecommerce-clone

A mini e-commerce made mainly with react

### Active deployments
* Vercel deploy - [https://pokemon-ecommerce-clone.vercel.app/](https://pokemon-ecommerce-clone.vercel.app/)

---
### Info
Inspired by the [official pokemon site](https://www.pokemon.com/el/) (Spanish version) (<b>Project for educational purposes only!!!</b>)

Some modifications were made to it to fulfill the purpose of being an e-commerce, it is not identical, but several classes of the original are used

The most current changes are in the [develop branch](https://github.com/Arguel/pokemon-ecommerce-clone/tree/develop), the responsive design still needs to be done

### How to open/run the project

(This is assuming that you know how to handle the console of your operating system and want to test the project on your own, if you do not want to download anything you can see it in the link that appears at the beginning of the description - [Vercel deploy](https://pokemon-ecommerce-clone.vercel.app/))

1 - Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (I recommend installing the LTS - Long Term Support)

2 - Clone the repository, you can use the following command: <br/> <code> git clone https://github.com/Arguel/pokemon-ecommerce-clone.git </code>

3 - Navigate to the folder that was cloned and install the dependencies with <code>npm install</code>

4 - When the dependencies have finished installing/downloading, run the following command <code>npm start</code>

5 - And voila!, If a new window does not open automatically, you can try going to the default port that is usually hosted at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
